# GTgram Performance Improvement Plan

This document outlines several performance optimizations implemented and proposed for the GTgram application.

## üîç Implemented Improvements

### 1. Image Loading and Carousel Optimization
- Implemented preloading strategy for image carousels to load adjacent images before they're shown
- Added base64 SVG placeholders for faster initial loading
- Prioritized loading of visible content with proper use of Next.js `priority` flag
- Memoized className calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 2. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- Implemented dynamic imports for Feed component to improve initial page load
- Added Suspense boundaries with appropriate loading states
- Added dynamic imports for StoryBar component to further reduce initial bundle size

### 3. React Performance Optimizations
- Added React.memo to components like UserAvatar and MobileNavBar to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented useCallback for event handlers and frequently recreated functions
- Added useMemo for expensive calculations and UI components that don't change often

### 4. Firebase Optimizations
- Implemented user data caching to prevent redundant Firestore queries
- Added time-based filtering to limit the data being fetched
- Used Promise.all for batch processing of posts and parallel data loading

### 5. Code Cleanup
- Removed debug `console.log` statements in production
- Configured next.config.js to automatically remove console statements in production
- Improved image compression utility with development-only logging

### 6. Next.js Configuration Enhancements
- Added image optimization settings
- Enabled CSS optimization for production builds
- Enhanced First Contentful Paint with optimisticClientCache
- Fixed config compatibility issues for better stability

### 7. Performance Monitoring
- Added Web Vitals tracking to monitor Core Web Vitals metrics
- Implemented route change tracking for SPA navigation
- Added infrastructure for analytics integration

## ‚ö° Potential Further Improvements

### 1. Additional Image and Media Optimizations
- Upgrade more image components to use responsive sizes for better mobile performance
- Implement progressive image loading for larger photos
- Add reduced motion preferences for accessibility

### 2. Server-Side Rendering & Static Generation
- Implement getStaticProps/getServerSideProps for data-heavy pages
- Use Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic content
- Consider transitioning more components to server components where applicable

### 3. Advanced Firebase Optimizations
- Implement composite indexes for complex queries
- Add proper security rules to minimize unnecessary reads
- Consider using Firebase Functions for performance-critical operations

## üìä Expected Impact

- **Image Carousel**: 30-40% faster image loading when navigating
- **Initial Page Load**: 20-30% reduction in LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Bundle Size**: 15-25% reduction through code splitting and dynamic imports
- **Overall Performance Score**: 20+ point improvement in Lighthouse performance score

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Review Web Vitals metrics in development console
   - Setup proper analytics integration for production
   - Run Lighthouse audits to verify improvements

2. **User Testing**
   - Validate performance improvements on various devices and network conditions
   - Get feedback on perceived performance improvements

3. **Further Optimizations**
   - Based on monitoring data, identify and address remaining bottlenecks
   - Continually refine the application's performance
